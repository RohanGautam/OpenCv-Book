# My code follow-throughs and implementations for the book - *Practical Python and opencv* by Dr. Adrian Rosebrock

## Thoughts after completion
This was a really fun book to follow along and do, and the author is well-known in the industry. He explains stuff right from the basics really well, and I can definitely say I got a more solid grasp of image processing fundamentals.
Another thing I really liked is a healthy mix of practical code and theory!
